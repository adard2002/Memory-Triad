       <h2>Adara Townsend</h2>
       <span class="caption">My name is Adara Townsend and I just graduated from highschool last year in 2020. I went into coding right after high school and I have a few friends who do coding in their free time and I want to be able to possibly help them with their coding. I have always played video games since I could first pick up a Playstation controller. The Playstation 2 was my first gaming console I've ever played on and I am always looking forward to learning more about coding and video games.</span><br>

       <h2>Daniel Rogahn</h2>
       <span class="caption">My name is Daniel Rogahn. I got an Associate's Degree in Early Childhood Education in 2005 from Kirkwood CCU.
         I am a single father of a 15 year old son.  I first began coding while in 7th grade when my father bought me a TRS-80 from a garage sale that used BASIC as its
         operating system and native programming language. For over 20 years coding has been a hobby with which I pick up a language in my spare
         time and write a game or two after getting the hang of it and then put back down to pursue the more pressing duties of life.  I have some
         working knowledge of BASIC, C++, C#, Python3, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS.  I'm currently enrolled in a coding 'bootcamp'
         through DeltaV Code School and am close to finishing 201.</span><br>
