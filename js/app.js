/*THis is our JavaScript Code for a quiz application that runs on our webpage
and displays the scoreboard in the <aside>. The quiz contains a bank of questions
stored as an array of objects.  There are three radio buttons on the page that
will start a fresh quiz with 10, 20, or 30 questions. The quiz is multiple choice
with the answers being displayed on four buttons. Every time a button is pressed
the answer is evaluated and a score possibly incremented, and a new random question
is selected from the database and displayed with it's answers on the buttons.
The highscore list loads an object from localStorage upon loading the page and
every time a quiz is completed it is checked for placement amongst the top three
high sores and if it is a new high score it is added to the list that persists
to display or update from localStorage.
