When it came to come up with ideas for this project, we pretty quickly settled on Adara's suggestion for a creature memory quiz. After that it was easy to come up with what ideas we wanted to implement for it. We knew we wanted to display cards of the creaturs, have an about us page, and a quiz that would ask the user questions related to different creatures. We orginally got 3 creatures each and found facts for them and came up with questions. We then expanded this list to 20 total creatures and a randomized quiz for them. We met a few stretch goals along the way and a few issues as well, but as a team we were able to come together and handle them.
